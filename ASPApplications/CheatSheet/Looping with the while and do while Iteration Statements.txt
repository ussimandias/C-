Looping with the while and do ... while Iteration Statements
============================================================

	Random random = new Random();
	//random.Next(lowerBounds, upperBounds)
	random.Next(1, 100); // returns a value between 1 and 100

	//If someExpression is already false, this will never execute
	while(someExpression){
		//Code that would affect whether
		//someExpress is true or false
	}

	//If some expression is already false, this will run atleast once
	do {
		// Code that
	}
	while(someExpression)
