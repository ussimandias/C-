Changine the Length of an Array
================================

Arrays are Immutable - cannot be changed in memory.
However .NET Famework provides helper methods to 
resize an array... creates a new array and copies 
the old values into it.

	Array.Resize(ref myArray, myArray.Length + 1);

//Get the highest index:
	int highestIndex = myArray.GetUpperBound(0);
//0 = dimension we want to retrieve the upper boundary for

Arrays have other helper methods
=================================

	myArray.Sum()
    myArray.Max()
    myArray.Min()
    myArray.Average()
    myArray.Sort()
    myArray.Reverse()
