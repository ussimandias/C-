Arithmetic Operators (CS-ASP_009)
=================================
	= NOT equality, it's assignment

Math Operators: + - * /

Addition Assignment
	total = total + 5;
	total += 5;

Increment Operator: i++;
Decrement Operator: i--;

Beware of order of precedence (use parenthesis)
Beware of down casting (you'll lose precision)
Beware of overflow (use bigger types)

To make overflow throw an exception:

	checked
	{
	// some arithmetic operation
	// that could potentially overflow
	}
